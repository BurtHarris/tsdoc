> TSDoc is aiming to be an augmentation or replacement of
> [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/TypeDoc), a documentation generator
> for TypeScript and JavaScript. The main features of this new version are a
> pluggable architecture, full themability and a flexible and highly
> configurable output.

:point_up: We could use a helping hand. If you think you're up for it, [open an issue](https://github.com/TypeForce/tsdoc/issues/new).

:warning: tsdoc is under heavy development. The current code is still unstable
and does not generate full documentation just yet. If you want to know, just
[watch](https://github.com/TypeForce/tsdoc/watchers) the repository.
